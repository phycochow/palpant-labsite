        What do Q1 through Q5 mean?
      </div>
      <div class="qa-card-body">
        <div class="qa-answer-content">
          <p><strong>General Answer:</strong> Q1 = top-performing quantile for a given metric, Q5 = lowest-performing, Q2–Q4 = intermediate ranges. Categories are algorithmically determined to maximize balanced representation.</p>
          <p><strong>Technical Answer:</strong> Supplemental Table XX provides quantitative ranges linking each Q-bin to physiological values for every parameter. Algorithm optimizes bin count to maintain ±1 protocol per bin, enabling maximum resolution given available data. This ensures meaningful relative performance comparisons across heterogeneous studies.</p>

        Does the permutation test assume independence between features?
      </div>
      <div class="qa-card-body">
        <div class="qa-answer-content">
          <p>No—each feature is treated independently. Values within each variable column are randomly shuffled to generate perturbed datasets forming null distributions. This allows assessment of each feature's independent association with maturation outcomes.</p>

        Why use quantile bins rather than alternative categorization methods?
      </div>
      <div class="qa-card-body">
        <div class="qa-answer-content">
          <p>Algorithm optimizes bin number to maximize resolution while maintaining balanced protocol representation. Alternative approaches don't account for balanced bins or address uneven data distribution (many protocols are left-skewed toward immature outcomes). The method ensures maximum interpretability given data sparsity.</p>

        Can you clarify the conclusion about independent modulation of maturation parameters?
      </div>
      <div class="qa-card-body">
        <div class="qa-answer-content">
          <p><strong>General Answer:</strong> Recent literature (Fetterman et al.) shows hPSC-CM maturity is compartmentalized. CMPortal supports this: protocol variables driving one maturity metric often differ from those driving others.</p>
          <p><strong>Technical Answer:</strong> Maturation metrics showed limited correlation. Contractile force associated with tensioned 3D constructs, DMEM media, and specific Wnt patterns. Sarcomere length, calcium kinetics, and conduction velocity each linked to different protocol features. This indicates maturation isn't governed by a single unified axis but reflects multiple partially independent pathways. Optimizing one property doesn't guarantee simultaneous enhancement of others.</p>

      </div>
      <div class="qa-card-body">
        <div class="qa-answer-content">
          <p><strong>General Answer:</strong> Protocols are rank-ordered by reported values for each metric and divided into maximally balanced quantiles. Highest-value quantile = "best", lowest-value quantile = "worst".</p>
          <p><strong>Technical Answer:</strong> Supplemental Table XX provides quantitative ranges linking Q-bins to physiological values for every parameter. Polynomial model illustrates how significant enrichments scale with sample size—not a mechanistic relationship but statistical demonstration that sufficient database diversity exists to recover meaningful associations. Number of recoverable features plateaus at ~20–30, providing robustness justification.</p>

        Why do measurement tools like traction force microscopy appear enriched?
      </div>
      <div class="qa-card-body">
        <div class="qa-answer-content">
          <p><strong>General Answer:</strong> Measurement tools describe how contractility was quantified, not causal factors. They appear because they report co-occurrence patterns.</p>
          <p><strong>Technical Answer:</strong> Biologically manipulable protocol components (media, supplements, cell sources, culture geometry) should be interpreted as candidate causal levers. Measurement modalities report co-occurrence but aren't causal. New CMPortal toggle restricts display to putative causal variables, hiding descriptive/methodological features. Supplemental Table XX provides numeric boundaries for all Q-bins.</p>

        Is the Frank-Starling independence claim overgeneralized from limited validation?
      </div>
      <div class="qa-card-body">
        <div class="qa-answer-content">
          <p><strong>General Answer:</strong> We've revised to state that contractility and sarcomere length are "decoupled" rather than "independent." Our validation provides proof-of-principle that CMPortal generates testable hypotheses.</p>
          <p><strong>Technical Answer:</strong> Database analysis across 300+ protocols showed no correlation between sarcomere length and contractile force (ρ not significant). Experimental validation using DMEM+fatty acids vs RPMI+B27 demonstrated increased contractility without sarcomere length change—consistent with database prediction. While fatty acids are known to improve contractility, no prior study examined whether this occurs independently of structural maturation. Our finding challenges the untested assumption that these metrics co-develop.</p>

        <div class="qa-answer-content">
          <p>Table S3 reveals several non-intuitive correlations: sarcomere length doesn't correlate with contractile force/stress despite traditional assumptions; fibroblast ratio positively associates with longer sarcomeres (ρ = 0.72, p < 0.001) but negatively with calcium relaxation (ρ = –0.75, p < 0.05); beat rate strongly negatively correlates with insulin withdrawal duration (ρ = –0.78, p < 0.05). These context-dependent patterns extend beyond established maturation paradigms.</p>

        How does CMPortal reconcile with Ewoldt et al.'s finding that no maturation strategy consistently outperforms others?

        <div class="qa-answer-content">
          <p>CMPortal doesn't claim universal maturation solutions—it reveals context-specific associations between protocol features and outcomes. Different maturation strategies work for different endpoints. Our database enables hypothesis-driven protocol optimization targeting specific maturation axes rather than assuming one-size-fits-all approaches.</p>
